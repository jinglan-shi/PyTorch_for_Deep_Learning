# PyTorch for Deep Learning
This repository contains the implementation of the exercises and projects from the [Zero to Mastery PyTorch course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-pytorch/).

It is more about gaining practical hands-on **coding experience** with implementing machine learning models using PyTorch as the framework, which is slightly different from the TensorFlow framework that I have already gained certification in, although the underlying architecture of machine learning models in PyTorch is similar to that of TensorFlow.

## Contents
The repository is organized in plain `.ipynb` files, each corresponding to a section of the course. Here is an overview of the contents:

* Section 1: Introduction to PyTorch
* Section 2: PyTorch Fundamentals
* Section 3: PyTorch Workflow
* Section 4: PyTorch Neural Network Classification
* Section 5: PyTorch Computer Vision
* Section 6: PyTorch Custom Datasets
* Section 7: PyTorch Going Modular
* Section 8: PyTorch Transfer Learning
* Section 9: PyTorch Experiment Tracking

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* torch 1.12+
* torchvision 0.13+

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learn-pytorch.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
The repository is organized into folders, each containing the code for a specific section or project of the course. To run the code for a specific section or project, navigate to the corresponding folder and run the Python file.

For example, to run the code for section 2, navigate to the section2 folder and run python main.py.
